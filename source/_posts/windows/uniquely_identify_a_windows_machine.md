## MAC address

Using MAC address to identify a computer isn't reliable. Because each computer can easily have multiple MAC address from multiple network adapters(Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, even virtual network adapters).

## wmic csproduct get UUID

That UUID is the best way to ID a machine, it exists in Windows, Mac and many other platforms. It is 32 characters in length, a universally unique identifier. You can run the above wmic command to get it.

But wait, thatâ€™s not always the case. Some of the motherboard vendors might not include this UUID in their motherboard, which is quite common on those non-OEM machines. In that case, when you use wmic trying to retrieve it you will get all FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF as the ID back.

## Windows Product ID

Activation of Windows may change the value.

## Hard Drive's serial number

Using the SN of the HD volume actually works, though when testing it on various systems, I've sometimes needed more privileges, so I stopped pursuing that path. It fails when running from (Linux) Live-OS.

## System.Identity.UniqueID

[System.Identity.UniqueID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/properties/props-system-identity-uniqueid)

not much infomations.

## CPUID

CPUID isn't unique. At least, not since last ~10 years. Intel deactivated that feature long ago. Usually some zero-ed string is returned, when someone tries to read the specific variable.

## HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid"

MachineGuid is unique unless Windows is restored from a backup or clone.
